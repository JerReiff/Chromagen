# Chromagen
A module allowing for frequency analysis of .WAV files
Repo is a work in progress, and so far the implementation still relies on SciPy's FFT algorithm.
The module was written with the Anaconda Distribution, and currently requires installation of Scipy and Numpy, (and Matplotlib for the demo), though an effort may be made soon to remove Scipy from the list of dependencies.
Included is a demo of the module, as well as an exploratory data analysis using K-means clustering on the MAESTRO V1.0.0 dataset
