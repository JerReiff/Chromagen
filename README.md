# Chromatic-K-Means-Clustering
Allows the user to perform K-Means clustering on WAV files based on chromatic makeup.
Repo is a work in progress, and so far only STFT, spectrogram, and chromagram functionality have been implemented, which still relies on SciPy's FFT algorithm.
The module was written with the Anaconda Distribution, and currently requires installation of Scipy and Numpy, (and Matplotlib for the demo), though an effort may be made soon to remove Scipy from the list of dependencies.
